# Sub30s Buddhist Group 

<!-- ![Am I responsive image](readme-assets/am-i-responsive.jpg) -->

<hr>

My idea for this project was to develop a concept website for the Sub30s Buddhist Group which I regularly attend. The purpose of the website is to provide some general information on the group (including What we do?, When we meet?, Where we meet?), an introduction into Buddhism and Meditation, and an oppertunity to get in touch to request further infromation.

# Design

**Text & Background color**

I selected both the text and background colors to keep the website simple. I wanted to keep the main background white and introduce color into the website through the images used. I decided to use a light grey for the header and the footer to provide some contrast from the main sections.

# Features

## Existing Features:

### Languages Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

### Navigation

A three navigation buttons (one per page) have been provided in the top right section of the header to allow for the user to easily locate and use. The location of the navigation buttons change with smaller screens -- these are as such located under the logo due to the smaller screen space available.

<!-- ![Navigation bar and logo](readme-assets/navigation.jpg) -->

### Home Page Hero Banner

A Hero Image is used on the Home Page (only) under the Header. The text over the Hero Image, 'Buddha - Dharma - Sangha', has been added to break up the image and has been included to improve the design. 'Buddha - Dharma - Sangha' are the Three Jewels of Buddhism and are an important part of the teachings.

### Home Page 

**Main Section**

This page provides a brief explanation about 1) What the Aurora Borealis is 2) Where the best places are to see it and 3) When the best time to see it is

Whilst the explanations are relatively brief, there is still a paragraph break in each section to make it easier to read. Every question (and answer) has been separated with its own textbox for easy reading and without overwhelming the user with one large paragraph of text. 

![Who we are?]()

 

![What we do?]()



![When we meet?]()



![Where to find us?]()

### Footer

The footer section features a note that this site is for educational purposes only and links to four social media sites.

The note regarding this site being for educational purposes only has been included as I do not have the rights to some of the content and media used on the website. The content and media has been credited in this document.

### Buddhism and Meditation



<!-- To provide some less scientific/more fun information for the user, I decided to add some "fun facts" about the Aurora on this page. 

As this page does not contain any visuals I decided to add some atmospheric, subject-appropriate music instead, whilst reading more about the Aurora. The Track is called â€˜Northern Lightsâ€™ and has been written specifically for this project. -->

**Metta Bhavana and The Mindfulness of Breathing Meditation**


<!-- ![Live cam link section](readme-assets/live-cams.jpg) -->

### Get in Contact 

This page allows the user an opportunity to get in contact with the group and find out more information.

<!-- ![Contact form](readme-assets/contact-form.jpg) -->

### Thank you

<!-- Upon submitting the form the user will be redirected to a new page, which will thank them for signing up and that if they left a comment someone will respond within 48 hrs. No user information will be stored.

### Unfixed Bugs

I have found that the spacing below some of the text sections of the 'Buddhism & Meditation' page are quite large taking away from the design of the page.

I plan to fix this in the future.

### Libraries & Programs used:

- Github: Store repositry
- Gitpod: Create the html and css files
- Google Fonts: Font-family '#'
- Font Awesome: Social media icons
- Am I Responsive:

# Credits

<!-- I faced many challenges during this project and before I go into further details I wanted to thank the Slack community for all their great support and my Mentor [Martina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinaterlevic/) for her amazing support and helpful tips to take this project off the ground. ðŸ˜ƒ -->

As a starting point I looked at the Coders Coffee and Love Running projects.

- From the Love Running Project, I took inspiration for the header, hero banner, footer and form.
- From the Coders Coffee Project, I took inspiration from in my 'What we do?' section.
